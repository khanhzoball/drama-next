He has resolved to become a benevolent monarch who will reform the law when he eventually takes the throne, but the way his father was killed has scarred him emotionally.  At court, he meets a young woman named Sung Deok Im. Yi San falls in love with her and tries to convince her to become his official concubine. But Sung Deok Im is strong-willed and free-spirited. She is also intelligent enough to understand that becoming a royal consort to the future king is a prestigious role, but one that would restrict her freedom and likely bring her little in the way of joy. But Yi San’s love for Sung Deok Im is true, and she starts to understand that forming a union with him could ultimately benefit his troubled realm.    ~~ Adapted from the novel \"The Sleeve's Red Cuff\" (옷소매 붉은 끝동) by Kang Mi Kang (강미강).",

    "synopsis": "Back in the 1990s, the citizens of Seoul were gripped with a paralyzing fear after a series of brutal attacks and murders occurred. A mysterious figure dubbed ‘Red Cap’ was stalking women on the streets then killing his prey, seemingly without provocation. His habit of striking at random made it impossible for the detectives to predict his next move. At the top of their minds is what could be triggering him.   Aware of the American F.B.I. and its successful use of criminal profilers to identify serial killers, the head of the Criminal Behavioral Analysis team, Gook Young Soo recruits Song Ha Young, a quiet, reserved, incredibly perceptive former detective for his team. Gook believes using this new psychological method will give the police an edge in capturing 'Red Cap' and ending his killing spree.   Homicide expert Yoon Tae Goo and her officers question the value of this approach and are resistant to entering such uncharted territory.

    "synopsis": "Controlled by a complex network of cells, each and every human on the planet is kept running by an unseen operating system that is, for the most part, completely ignored. Though humans never give much thought to how they manage to function, day in and day out, the cells within the human body are constantly at work, doing their part to keep their human alive and well. Which is why on the outside, Kim Yoo Mi may appear to be just like every other single working woman in the world, but underneath that ordinary exterior lies something truly extraordinary.   Having recently suffered a painful breakup, Yoo Mi’s love cells have fallen into a deep coma. While the surrounding cells work hard to revive their fallen compatriots, Yoo Mi spends her days stuck in the grind of everyday life. With a heart still broken and no romantic prospects, Yoo Mi’s love cells might have been in serious trouble had it not been for the sudden appearance of Goo Woong. An emotionally stunted game developer, Goo Woong has no idea how to express his true feelings, but after meeting Yoo Mi, he finds himself wanting to try. With his own love cells unexpectedly sparking Yoo Mi’s back to life, things between the two start to get interesting.  With both Yoo Mi and Goo Woong’s cells working overtime, the two find themselves drawing ever closer. But will the efforts of this small collection of cells really be enough to bring two hearts together forever?   ~~ Adapted from the webtoon \"Yumi's Cells\" (유미의 세포들) by Lee Dong Geon (이동건).",

Her grandmother was a shaman so from a young age she’s been able to occasionally see ghosts, though it’s not until she meets the lascivious ghost that she gets possessed totally. Sun Woo is a conceited star chef who’s overflowing with confidence in his food and his skills. Bong Sun harbours a secret crush on him, though he doesn't take much notice of her for two reasons: because he’s always surrounded by women and because he’s hung up on an old flame. But then one day, Bong Sun starts acting differently, shedding her mousy personality, and ends up constantly on Sun Woo’s mind.",

But as the rest of the group – whom he knows nothing about – have decided to leave him to do all the work on his own, he decides to remove their names, and make the presentation in his name.  But little did he know that when he did this, he would deal a heavy blow to the academic prospects of a senior student named Jang Jae Young.

While the events were never fully understood, nor the mystery behind them solved, the stories surrounding the village slowly faded, drifting into obscurity amidst the steady passing of time. But when a new string of mysterious incidents begin to take place, memories long-forgotten begin to resurface, and this time, the villagers' cries for help will not go unheard.   A legend among his peers, Do Jung Woo is the leader of one of the National Police Agency’s special task forces. While his outward appearance likens him more to an unruly child than a legendary officer, his keen insight and quick wit make him more than capable of solving any crime. After reports of numerous mysterious incidents begin to filter in, Jung Woo springs into action. But this isn’t a mystery he’s allowed to solve on his own. Working alongside Jung Woo, Officer Gong Hye Won refuses to let anything stand between her and what she wants.   Tenacious and hot-tempered, she’s determined to solve every case, by any means necessary, and this case is no exception. Joined by Jamie, a detective on loan from the FBI, Jung Woo and Hye Won set out to unravel the present mysteries of this small village. But they soon realize that the incidents of the present tie strongly to those of the past. Will this team of experts be able to solve a case nearly thirty years in the making? ",

Seo Gong Myung is guided by his moral convictions, which he staunchly adheres to, opting to do everything ‘by the book’.  His lack of flexibility and his penchant for criticizing all those who enter his domain, not only serve to earn him the nickname ‘Great Lucifer’, but more enemies than friends.

Small wonder the opening on the District People's Council, with an annual salary of 50 million won for a mere 90 working days, could be just the ticket she needs to better her circumstances.

After a revolving door of unfulfilling retail jobs, Seo Dal Mi is unsatisfied with the current trajectory of her life. Her soul longs for a grand adventure that sees her at the top and managing her own company. Although she does not have much to offer, she has big dreams, red hot ambition, and the soul of a pioneer.  A constant source of his family's pride as a child, Nam Do San as an adult is the founder of Sam San Tech, a fledgling start-up company that is looking to transition into bigger endeavors. But a vague dream and limited ambition see his company flounder. Unknown to him, the tailwinds of fate has begun to fill up SST's sails.  Han Ji Pyeong, a man who does not want to owe anyone anything, owes a large debt to one special person who helped him greatly in the past. His role in the start-up world sees him as Judge, Jury, and Executioner, as his pragmatic advice sees the futures of start-ups either rise into greatness or fall into obscurity.  Tired of doing all the work, but seeing the credit go to someone else, Won In Jae yearns to prove herself in a male-dominated industry, as a capable woman who can succeed without the advantages her privileged childhood has given her.

The group members couldn't be more troublesome--especially, San Ma Roo, the solo male traveler. He fought with his girlfriend 3 days before the trip and then left her behind at the office while he still takes a vacation. He is a nuisance from day one when he is trapped in customs. Surprisingly, during the trip, So So learns that Ma Roo just might be her fated lover.   ",

    "synopsis": "With their municipality scheduled to be flooded to make way for the construction of a new dam, the devout denizens of a rural village have placed their faith in Choi Gyung Seok, a church elder who promises to relocate the flock. Choi tells the villagers they will build a church and a new housing development where they will all be able to live together after the town is completely submerged. He also says that only 144,000 people can go to heaven, and that church offerings are mandatory if one wants to \"secure their spot.\" Even the town's much-revered Reverend Sung, a young and good-looking minister who seemingly has the ability to heal the sick, approves of Choi's plans. Behind his guise of devotion, however, Choi is a practiced con man posing as a representative of a fake religion; his true aim is to defraud the villagers of their resettlement compensation. The only obstacle to the scheme is Kim MinChul, a skeptical outcast who accidentally discovers evidence of Choi's past misdeeds and suddenly finds himself becoming the center of resistance against the church institution.   ~~ Based on the 2013 animated film The Fake.",

One is a \"media jackal\", a journalist who will write any story, fact or fiction, in order to get views, and the other is a \"vegetative journalist\" who hasn't been able to write a single article for five years. These two journalists, with the help of a prosecutor work together in order to seek the truth.",

But his life is about to turn on its head: The student with the lowest grades in his class is found dead in what at first appears to have been a suicide, and a girl named Ga Doo Shim transfers into his class.  Ga Doo Shim longs to be a run-of-the-mill high schooler, but she is fated to become a mighty, evil spirit-chasing shaman. The only problem is she struggles to see spirits, both evil and benevolent. Her grandmother once told her that if she could survive being 18, she would be able to live a normal life. But the death of the student with low grades soon turns out to have a supernatural link. And furthermore, she soon learns that Na Woo Soo has suddenly gained the ability to see spirits. Together, they realize, they have the power to fight back against the powers of evil, which are now threatening to overrun the school. But could their ghost-busting partnership one day blossom into romance?  ",

    "synopsis": "When Pyo In Sook was a child, her parents abandoned her with her grandmother who raised her. Her life has never been easy or comfortable. She now works at a public bathhouse scrubbing customer's bodies. Her defense mechanism is to not express her feelings to other people. One day, a doctor tells her she has a terminal illness and will die soon. Even coming face-to-face with her own mortality, In Sook remains emotionless.   She begins receiving care at a hospice and meets two women with lives very different from her own: Seong Mi Do, a social media influencer, and Kang Se Yeon, an ordinary housewife who feels lonely and taken for granted. One rainy day, In Sook meets Min Woo Cheon, a contract killer who works at a private detective office. Woo Cheon's cool exterior masks a deep sadness. Each of the three women decides to end the life of one person who has done them wrong before they die, but in becoming friends, their anger begins to subside. When In Sook and Woo Cheon develop feelings for each other, though, she begins to rethink her plans.  ",

Determined to become the first Empress of Goguryeo, Pyeong Gang will stop at nothing to make her dream come true. Clever and level-headed, Pyeong Gang is well aware of the obstacles that stand in her way, but she's more than capable of taking them on. However, things take an unexpected turn the day she meets On Dal, a peace-loving man whose sole goal in life is to live in harmony with those around him.   On Dal is the exact opposite of the ambitious princess. He is an oasis of calm amid the turbulent storms in Pyeong Gang's life. The warrior princess soon finds herself falling for gentle On Dal. He's equally in love with the princess, whose heart he now possesses. He finds himself forsaking his principles to keep her safe, an endeavor proving to be increasingly difficult, as warring factions lethally vie for the throne. Forced to match both wits and strength against some of the most powerful people in Goguryeo, Pyeong Gang's quest for power could very well cost her everything. Does she have what it takes to realize her goals, or will the price prove to be too much to pay?    ~~ Adapted from the novel “Princess Pyeonggang” (평강공주) by Choi Sa Gyu (최사규).",

But during the ultra-conservative Joseon Dynasty era (1392-1910), the only woman with the power to order a manhunt for a murderer is the Queen. So Kang Eun Bo resolves to win the prized royal title so she can one day avenge her sister’s death. To do so, however, she must first win the heart of Joseon King Lee Kyung. Lee Kyung grew up in a time of great political unrest, and is less interested in matters of the heart – and more concerned with bringing peace to the realm. Kang Eun Bo soon discovers that winning the king’s favor will not be easy; the royal court is also inundated with beautiful young women, many of whom hope to wed the king. But when the king suddenly realizes that he recognizes Kang Eun Bo from a dream, the two begin to form an unlikely bond. Will Kang Eun Bo ever find her twin’s killer? And could love bloom between the streetwise Kang Eun Bo and the idealistic king?  ",

In the Joseon era, she finds the notion of any woman suffering in silence during her marriage intolerable. She wholeheartedly and passionately is in support of divorce. And small wonder!

Saving Hyo Min from the bullies at school when they were children, Bo Seok has been by her side ever since. Growing up together, they have shared every moment of their lives, both good and bad, developing a friendship like no other.  As adults, the two have occasionally struggled with the feelings stronger they seem to have inadvertently developed for each other. Never wanting to damage such a precious friendship, the two have always been conflicted when it came to sharing their deeper feelings. On occasion, Hyo Min and Bo Seok have been a little more open with their hearts, but it never goes beyond the feelings of a moment. For some reason, the timing between them is always just a little off.  But all that changes when Hyo Min loses her memory. Unexpectedly presented with the opportunity to take their relationship to the next level, Bo Seok seizes his moment, more than willing to take on this arduous task. He just needs to find a way to remind her of how much they mean to each other. Will Bo Seok’s efforts finally bring them together or will they become victims of poor timing once again?  ",

Unattached from her father, step-mother, and step-sister, and poorly treated by them, Ha Won still manages to maintain her bright personality and strong set of morals, working various part-time jobs to pay for her upcoming university tuition fees and keeping her eyes firmly glued to her goals. Meanwhile, in another part of the city are three spoiled cousins, Ji Woon, Hyun Min, and Seo Woo, living together in a mansion called Sky House. With their wildly different personalities - Ji Woon a tough guy, Hyun Min a playboy, and Seo Woo a musician - they all deeply dislike each other and prefer to be as far away from each other as possible. One day, their grandfather orders his 3 grandsons to attend his 5th wedding ceremony.

But it’s not the constant stream of guests that has Hae Won concerned; it’s the fact that the restaurant’s owner and head chef, Baek Eun Kyu, seems to have a serious problem with him. Having been recommended for a part-time job at the restaurant by Cha Ji Soo, a fellow restaurant owner, Hae Won thought he would easily fit in with the staff; but for some reason Eun Kyu seems to instantly dislike him.  Despite the fact that he can’t figure out why his boss is so bothered by him, Hae Won finds himself fitting in nicely with his fellow staff members, Ha Jin and Joo Seo Hyuk. It isn’t long before he’s drawing as much attention from the restaurant patrons as his equally handsome co-workers.  With such a good-looking staff, there’s never a shortage of admirers at the Florida Banjeom. It comes as no surprise to Hae Won that almost everyone who visits the restaurant eventually falls for the devastatingly handsome Eun Kyu. What does surprise him is when he realizes that he himself has fallen. But will he ever be able to win the heart of his cold-hearted boss?   ",

    "synopsis": "This romantic comedy follows a woman who has an aversion to flower boys and a man who has an obsession with appearance.   The female lead, Joo Seo Yeon, is a hot-tempered physical education high school teacher who always wears sneakers, jeans and training uniforms.  The death of her parents helped instill a deep sense of compassion, a generous heart and an outspoken objection for anyone who drinks and drives. Living in a house with three irascible and very attractive brothers, she loathes flower boys. Her ideal type is someone who is “not handsome.”   In contrast, the male lead, Lee Kang Woo, is a handsome chaebol who focuses primarily on outer appearance. Initially, he craved attention, oozed arrogance and loved his looks--despite the strict diet and exercise regimen required to maintain it. While he appears flawless, he (like everyone else) was wounded while growing up. And those flaws--along with everyone else's--drive the story.    Sparks fly when they meet and struggle to overcome their biases for and against people with flaws. Throughout the drama they learn to see beyond appearances to the tragic backstories and scars that motivate themselves and the people around them.  ",

This leads him to leave the military. In his new civilian life, he gets hired by a foreign retail distribution company and becomes the head manager of a large retail store. The retailer he works for slashes labor costs by firing part-time workers before they can qualify for benefits and higher wages. He cannot tolerate the company's poor and immoral treatment, so he decides to fight against the management. However, as he faces pressure from the company, he is forced to seek help from a labor counseling center and meets Go Shin, the center's manager.

He knew NHS from elementary school and was infatuated with her. Between him and LES, who would NHS choose?\n \n (DW)",

Although her glittering journalistic career spans a decade, her home situation is not quite as idyllic as those she spends her time reporting on. In fact, she lives alone in a rented house and happily makes adjustments as she sees fit. But when the magazine’s CEO Yoo Ja Sung buys the house and becomes her fussy new landlord, she is in for a shock.  Yoo Ja Sung proves to be a very difficult landlord to keep happy. He grew up in poverty, initially working in the construction industry, but determined to make his fortune through real estate investment. For him, buying the house Na Young Won lives in is little more than another financial transaction. But as the duo starts to get to know one another, their attitudes toward the real estate market – and one another – start to change. Suddenly, Na Young Won starts to ask herself if she would be better off buying her own house...or beginning on an unlikely romance with her firm’s CEO!  ",

Using his formidable powers of persuasion, Han Ki Joon eventually gets scouted by the spokesperson's office after struggling in the early days of his career at the service.

He did not take the typical route to become a lawyer. After graduating from high school, he did not go to a university. He later passed the bar exam and became a lawyer. He is full of justice and has empathy for others. He will defend all kinds of petty offenders. A turning point occurs in his legal career when he becomes the first attorney to win a general criminal retrial case. Park Sam Soo is a reporter. After he graduated from a university, he worked as a non-permanent employee. Thanks to his excellent writing skills, he became a reporter. He looks for stories which are ignored or passed over by other reporters. He is soft-hearted and easily moved to tears. Though his work does not bring him financial stability, his writings are able to deeply move the hearts of readers, some of whom volunteer their own resources and skills to support his journalism. Working with Sam Soo is Lee Yoo Kyung who, despite a silver spoon upbringing, is a brave, justice-seeking rookie whose first scoop is Tae Yong's victorious retrial case. Seeing Tae Yong's courtroom performance, Yoo Kyung is, like Sam Soo, struck by his passion, empathy, and drive to bring justice to the victim.     ~~ Adapted from a book of the same title.",

They begin falling into a special kind of love, based on the unique subject of 'cellular memory' (medical term, a symptom where recipients remember the habits or personalities of the donors and since a body's cells store memory independently from the brain, it leads to an organ transplant's recipient to form new habits similar to the donor).

He accidentally causes an accident that leads to the death of a stranger. Park Tae Yi lives in the countryside with her grandfather and inherited her musical talents from her father. Ha Do Sung composes songs in anonymity as rock star HADES. Having been abandoned at a young age by his ambitious mother, he tries to live quietly without drawing attention to himself. Kim Byeong Gun is the odd one out in his family of businessmen, wishing to pursue a career in musicals - despite his debilitating fear of performing in front of others. Eun Chae Young is an experienced actress, having been in the industry for 10 years. However, she has the desire to prove herself on the musical stage, rather than a movie actress with a pretty face. What she doesn't expect is to be challenged by Oh Doo Ri, an equally talented actress who prefers to spend her time playing first-person shooting computer games than rehearsing.  These young adults end up together in the musical department of Haneul Arts University and find themselves under the guidance of unconventional professor Sunwoo Young. With each passing day, they get a chance to learn what it is to be a 'star,' and to prove to the people around them that they can succeed in their chosen path.",

After the deaths, Han Seung Min, a popular and high-profile forensic psychologist professor – and also a former flame of Yoo Hee’s – comes forward to confess to the crime. The police take him into custody and he is eventually sent to a high-security jail that positively teems with some of the nation’s most dangerous inmates.  But as Yoo Hee begins to investigate the crime, she cannot shake the hunch that Han Seung Min is not the killer after all – and that he may have other, hidden motives for confessing to the crime. But time is running out for her to solve the case: violence rules at the prison, where Han Seung Min appears to be on a mysterious quest of his own. Can she crack the riddle before time runs out? And if Han Seung Min really didn’t kill her father...then who did?    ~~ Adapted from the webtoon \"Crime Puzzle\" (크라임 퍼즐) by Meen.",

Thirty years ago, when her husband passed away in an accident, Kang Sunok raised her teenage daughters alone. She became famous for her cooking classes with the help of a talented young disciple named Park Eunsil. The oldest daughter, Hyeonjeong, eventually became a well-known news presenter. She has worked hard and never married, but as the story starts, changes are about to come as her boss favours younger women. Sunoks second daughter, Hyunsuk, cared more about pop music than about schoolwork, and stirred up intense dislike within her teacher. She got expelled from school due to a series of events, got married and had a daughter, Jeong Mari, at a young age. She made her child’s success her life’s priority and Mari studied hard to get her PhD in Korean literature before the age of 30.  As the drama starts, Hyunsuk is desperate to make more money to help her family, but things don’t go well. She happens to befriend a wealthy woman, Jang Moran, who becomes deeply involved with the family. Moran is elegant and rich, but she has kept a secret for 30 years – but can, or should, secrets be kept forever?   Jang Moran isn’t the only woman to enter the struggling family’s life. Na Hyeonae, winner of the Teacher of the Year award and a doting mother, and none other than the person who ruined Hyunsuk’s life, shows up. Hyunsuk makes a promise to herself to force an apology out of this woman – a mission that turns out not to be so easy.   In the meantime, Hyunsuk’s estranged husband does his best to quietly help, while three men with the same family name, Lee, also become important parts of the women’s lives.",

The band’s lead singer is Yoo Ha Young, whose YouTube cover version of a popular song became a viral online hit. However, she wants to become a singer in her own right – someone who is known for performing original material, rather than covers. But it looks like the group’s guitarist, Yoo Ha Young’s close friend Lee Ji Hoon, is developing feelings for her – as is Gong Chan Young, an older keyboard player who also joins the band. Meanwhile, there are also sparks flying between bassist and Yoo Ha Young’s best friend Lim Seo Eun and the band’s eclectic drummer and academic no-hoper Shim Tae Young.  ",

At the forefront of the team, it is the hotheaded detective Park Se Hyuk and the cold, commanding police chief, Jung Il Do. Se Hyuk's impulsive, act-first-think-later methods, instincts honed on the streets, and pesky habit of threatening resignation clashes with his superior Il Do's strict, by-the-book style. The two also share a painful past, with Il Do being the detective on the case involving the death of Se Hyuk's daughter. Along with tenacious reporter Jo Min Joo and the rest of the homicide squad, they must now overcome their differences to solve crimes together.",

    "synopsis": "Soo Hyun is a psychologist based in America who has famous celebrities as his patients. But he suddenly returns to Korea and opens a psychotherapy center. A fraud fortune-teller named Hye Rim steals all of Soo Hyun's clients with her uncanny ability to read people’s minds seconds after meeting them. With his pride wounded, Soo Hyun decides to come up with a psychological experiment to perform on Hye Rim for his own research and revenge for the loss of his clients. As part of this experiment, three attractive men, including Soo Hyun, use all their charms to seduce Hye Rim and make her fall in love with them. Soo Hyun believes that he cuts a dashing figure and is quite accomplished professionally compared to the other two men; Seung Chan, Soo Hyun’s brother, wins over women’s hearts by treating them like queens; Ji Ho is an attractive and eccentric young genius. Hye Rim hadn’t believed in love until she becomes the lover of three different men. As she is caught up in the whirlwind of a romance that follows, her cynicism towards love crumbles. Will Hye Rim remain in love with Soo Hyun even after she realizes that she was just a participant in his psychological love experiment? ",

Jin Yoo was betrayed and killed by her lover, Jang Tae Jung. Tae Jung, a smart, good-looking man from a humble background, had committed himself to lure and marry a tycoon's daughter \"against all odds,\" as part of an effort to get him into the upper class of society. Seon Yoo then meets Seo Ji Seok, an immature man from a rich family whose sister, Ji Hee, is married to Tae Jung. Ji Seok is at risk of losing the inherited family business to Tae Jung and Ji Hee since Ji Seok's mother is the family patriarch's second wife. To take revenge on the man responsible for her sister's death, Seon Yoo gives up her dream of becoming a nun. She marries Ji Seok and becomes Tae Jung's sister-in-law. Thus, Seon Yoo begins leading a double life: she pretends to be the ideal wife and daughter-in-law in front of the Seo family, and only takes off her mask in front of Tae Jung, proving she can be just as ruthless and vicious as Tae Jung. Seon Yoo wears her angel wings while hiding the dagger of revenge. ",

    "synopsis": "Ki Jin is a budding fashion design student who dreams big: He wants to become a world-famous clothing designer. But the journey to the top of South Korea’s fashion tree is not an easy one, and he is struggling to find the right path. One day, on the street, he bumps into Yeong Woo, an ever-optimistic part-time delivery worker. Even though it seems everyone he knows has formulated a grand plan about how their future will unfurl, Yeong Woo doesn’t have a dream. While all others are in a rush to get somewhere in life, it seems that his own life is stuck in first gear.  Although things have got off to a decidedly shaky start for Ki Jin and Yeong Woo, they start to develop a fondness for one another, and start to wonder if their seemingly opposing blend of determinedness and acceptance could be a case of “opposites attract.” But when a leading model named Lee Bin arrives on the scene, things get complicated. He starts to develop a crush on Ki Jin. Could this development spell the end for the fledgling romance between Ki Jin and Yeong Woo?  ",

Leaving behind the tangled mess of her twenties, Sa Ri is ready to make a fresh start. But walking away from the past is proving more difficult than she ever imagined.   Having recently broken up with her boyfriend, Sa Ri was hopeful she had left that part of her life in the past. But when he makes an unexpected return, things get complicated. As if dealing with her ex wasn’t confusing enough, Sa Ri begins to realize that one of her oldest friends, Pi Jung Won, has started to develop feelings for her. As she attempts to sort out her own feelings for the talented artist, Sa Ri finds herself frequently crossing paths with Ki Sun Jae, the handsome and friendly CEO of the company where she works. Though it’s not always easy to tell what Sun Jae is thinking, there are times when a single look from him is enough to make her confused heart flutter. To make matters worse, Sa Ri finds that she has inadvertently captured the attention of Yeon Ha Rim. Despite the fact that he’s several years younger than her, he has no qualms about expressing his feelings.  Inadvertently drawing the attention of four different men, Sa Ri finds herself completely unsure of what to do next. How can she find a way to move forward when every path seems blocked by a complicated mess of feelings?  ",

    "synopsis": "Three vibrant and successful women who work on a radio show have something in common: a happy marriage.     Bubbly host Boo Hye Ryung is in her thirties and has been married to the handsome lawyer Pan Sa Huyn for three years. This busy couple remains child-free by choice. Sa Huyn was first taken with her after seeing her play the drums.  Sa Pi Young is a hard-working producer for the show. In her forties, she has always done her best to take care of her home, daughter, and her charming husband, Shin Yoo Shin, psychiatrist and hospital director of the neuropsychiatry department.  By anyone's measure, Pi Young is the ideal wife.   The show’s dedicated writer Lee Si Eun, now in her fifties, has been married for thirty years to her sweet professor husband and they share two pre-teens. Park Hae Ryoon is now the dean of the Theatre and Film Department at  Sun Jin University. Lee Si Eun made many sacrifices in order to support her husband's dream of becoming a film professor early in their marriage.   Seo Ban, the show's sound technician is single, a man of few words who keeps a tight lid on his private life. He is a man of mystery to his curious colleagues.  Three equally successful women will prove to be the unraveling of each of their so-called 'happy marriages.'   Song Won is divorced, a  skilled literary translator of Chinese, and lawyer Sa Hyun's mature gym partner.  A Mi is single in her twenties and has spent the last two years shuttling between South Korea and the US in order to complete her studies. A shared airplane seat and a love of horses bring her and the doctor together. Add into the mix, Yoo Shin's unusual relationship with his father's new wife, a classy, well-kept woman who raised him from childhood. Dean Hae Ryoon hires the beloved actress, Nam Ga-Bin, whose career he has followed, to teach at the university, bringing the two in welcomed routine contact.     Mistresses aside, each couple has an achilles heel that brings about much unhappiness, could trigger divorce proceedings, and leave them all wondering just how much happiness are we entitled to in life?

At 20 years old, On Joon Yeong is a nerdy, smart university student who wears plain clothes, plain glasses, and doesn't obsess over fashion. He plans everything in his day meticulously, grows frustrated easily, overthinks things, and is very sensitive. With the guidance of his friends, he takes part in a blind date where he meets Lee Yeong Jae. Lee Yeong Jae is also 20 years old, doesn't attend university and instead works as an assistant hairdresser. Lee Yeong Jae has had a difficult life and is an orphan who looks up immensely to her brother, Lee Soo Jae, a barista. She is honest, hardworking, and somewhat daring: the complete opposite to Oh Joon Yeong. Her dream is to become rich, though she would rather get there by her own perseverance. One day, her friend takes her to a blind date group with university students. At the meeting, she encounters Joon Yeong and goes on a date with him. From there, at 20 years old, their love story begins. ",

With natural beauty and a slew of vampire abilities, Yeon Seo could be anything she wanted, but she has chosen to blend in with those who appear closest to her age. As a result, Yeon Seo now finds herself faced with one of life’s most difficult challenges: graduating from high school.  Fighting back her more vampiric urges, Yeon Seo does her best to blend in at school; a task that, for the most part, has been fairly easy. But when the sweet blood of her classmate, Song Meo Roo, attracts the attention of vampires and werewolves alike, things get a little more complicated. Trying desperately to ignore the siren call of Meo Roo’s blood, Yeon Seo takes it upon herself to protect her classmate from those who hunt him.   As Yeon Seo and Meo Roo run for their lives, the blood in his veins calls to her. Torn between family duty and the desires of her own heart, a war within Yeon Seo rages. Will she be able to embrace her humanity and resist the temptation of this boy’s sweet blood or will her vampire side rise victorious in the end?    ~~ Adapted from the webtoon \"The Sweet Girl\" (달달한그녀) by writer S and illustrator Nal Chi (날치).",

Taking refuge in a small rural village nestled deep in the heart of the South Korean countryside, Da Jun might have had a chance to start a brand new life, but fate, it seemed, would not be so kind.  Befriending Gong Yoon Tak and his friends, Gong Yoon Jae, Kim Kook Hee, and Hong Ae Ran, not long after her arrival, Da Jun could have spent her remaining teenage years in relative peace. But when the group discovers a perfectly cultivated field of marijuana growing just outside the village, everything changes. Unable to resist the urge to use this discovery to her advantage, Da Jun quickly pulls Yoon Tak and his friends into her world of drugs and crime. Though able to overcome one set of difficulties, the friends now find themselves forced to overcome an entirely different set of obstacles.  With their lives on the line, will Da Jun, Yoon Tak, and their friends be able to find a way out of the mess they’ve gotten themselves into before it’s too late?  ",

It is a special love story of a high school senior at a girls school with an IQ of 98 but ranking first in looks in her school and of a poor college student studying law. Eun Min meets Tae Kyeong, a college student, when she goes to the university library to run an errand for her sister. She instantly falls in love and lies to him about being a scenario writer and starts dating him. Tae Kyeong, of course, also falls in love with the charming Eun Min. However, Eun Min's lie doesn't last long.  Eun Min and Tae Kyeong meet each other again as a private tutor and student. Tae Kyeong tells Eun Min, who hates studying more than anything, that she should do something else if she doesn't want to go to college, and drags her to the HAJA Center. The reason she listened to him without any further worries is that she believed that he would not ask her to do something that's not right. She had faith in him. She thought that she would be able to live a different life if she were with him. Tae Kyeong was the first thing that had ever been only hers. Therefore, Eun Min decides to get married to him! The marriage was her first accomplishment. The ten-million-won-leased room in the basement that the in-laws found for them has no windows. But why worry about not having a window? One can just draw windows on the wall, place a bucket under the leak in the ceiling and hold a rat-catching event with Tae Kyeong in case there are rats! For some time at first, poverty was just a game for her.",

The remnants of the Japanese invasion force are desperate to go home but are also driven by the personal motivation to beat their greatest adversary, Admiral Yi Sun Shin, once and for all. Self-serving Ming generals and Joseon officials also fear Yi's growing popularity and its impact on their personal base of power. These incidentally combining ambitions fan King Seon Jo's paranoia and make him eventually fear that Yi might come after his throne, and after a series of what he calls acts of high treason he decides to have Yi arrested.  Yi, on the other hand, is determined to teach the Japanese a lesson for the atrocities they committed on the Korean people, and despite orders to remain quiet while the Japanese are to pull out without anymore bloodshed, he rallies his naval force and prepares for the upcoming battle. the battle commences and the Japanese are dealt a crippling blow, but Yi is fatally wounded by an arquebuse bullet. As he lays dying, the plot backtracks important stations of Yi's life, from his boyhood to his military career, his disgrace at the hands of his king and his reinstatement, back to the battle of Noryang, where he succumbs to his wound just as victory is declared.",

His younger brother, Choon Bo, is kind, caring, and submissive to him. The two brothers have not seen each other for nearly twenty years, since Choon Bo gave his youngest son, Yeong Goo, to Man Bo because he wanted a son. Choon Bo’s wife believes that her youngest son died at birth. Twenty years later, Choon Bo goes bankrupt, and with nowhere to go, asks his brother for help. Living in the small house next to Man Bo’s, Choon Bo brings his three children, his daughter-in-law, and his wife with him. Together they live towards a brighter day. Man Bo’s wife and daughter are eager to make Choon Bo’s daughter, Soo Jin’s life miserable. When Soo Jin and Mi Ree again fight over the same guy, it is no surprise that the nice girl wins. As two families clash over women, men, family secrets and money matters, the good guy teaches the “bad guy” a lesson – just like the Korean folktale.  ",

The middle sister of the three, Gyung Sook, divorced from her first marriage after her ex-husband’s affair, but she is having marital problems again with her second husband, Jung Wan. Haeng Sook tells Gyung Sook that there is no “right” way to live life and although the number of divorces she gets in her life is insignificant, she should try to love a man with all her heart before breaking up.

The youngest of the three, Hyo Sook, married the man she fell in love with at first sight, but her husband Sang Min doesn’t consider her a woman and constantly asks for divorce. Haeng Sook encourages her by saying that although it seems like the end of the world, life goes on.

When she runs into an old flame, she embarks on a reckless path.

Bright and cheerful, however, she pours her energy into her job as a track team coach, while secretly trying to repay her birth father's hospital bills.  Lee Ki, the youngest son, successfully graduated from med school and became an intern at a hospital, but his real dream is to become a musical actor. When he quits the hospital in order to take dance lessons, he must hide it from the rest of his family while dealing with his sisters' issues.  Enter Go Kyung Woo, a TV producer at a major network whose success has made him arrogantly indifferent to the troubles of others. When he and Lee Geum meet, sparks fly but can he learn to care about her, especially with her disease? Lee Ki, meanwhile, has another problem - he just might be falling in love with his sister-in-law...",

Her life becomes difficult after her father, a once-popular singer, meets with an accident that was planned by his wife. Dan Bi then finds out that she was adopted. Her stepmother takes advantage of her husband's comatose state to kick Dan Bi out of their house, all in a plot to sell his land to the ruthless chairman of a hospital company.  This revelation leads Dan Bi to begin searching for her birth mother by using her adoptive father's will as leverage, not knowing that the truth about what happened to her birth father is directly tied to the chairman. She encounters several people along the way: the chairman's grandson who falls for Dan Bi but is uncertain of the outcome if they became a couple; a divorced lawyer whom Dan Bi loves, but whose father is also connected to her birth father, which is the reason why the lawyer's mother disapproves of Dan Bi for her son; the lawyer's ex-wife, and their daughter who likes Dan Bi more than her own mother; a step-sister who sees Dan Bi as a roadblock to climbing the corporate ladder; and an ailing doctor who was not only the love of Dan Bi's adoptive father's life, but knows the real truth about Dan Bi's parentage.

In a society where young married couples are encouraged to have children without any provincial or government support for families with kids, working Korean couples are grappling with the issue of childcare. This TV series illustrates these issues and asks viewers what choice they would make for the sake of their children. ",

She finds herself working a number of odd jobs once she makes the big move to Seoul, determined to make her way in the world and work hard at a successful career. So-min (the character) is a little behind the fashions and tends to say weird things that puzzle people, but she’s got a warm heart and a generous personality. Sadly, though, it’s that trusting nature that also makes her a target for opportunists.  - Dramabeans",

But even so this story does not include any secrets about birth, love between half brothers and sisters, someone waiting for death because they have leukemia or cancer, and no one with amnesia. Instead it’s filled with how a few youths, who have burning passion inside them, go through the everyday ups and downs of life and mixed fortunes with love and fate. The characters have distinct personalities and are full of fun. This drama will trigger something in young people who think that love is just a spur of the moment, in a world where everything is becoming digital to the extreme, by drawing the warmth that human love points to and by showing them a way of finding the truth about love. -Drama Wiki",

When Ok Hwa comes to Korea to work under Ryu Shi Won's uncle, Ryu Shi Won tries to pretend like he never knew Ok Hwa, which doesn't work out. They always get in fusses and fights, but those are what bring them closer together. On the other hand, Ok Hwa lives with her boss's sister and her two children. The twins, Su Jin and Mi Jin (Park Jin Hee) are bright kids that grew up very well despite the difficult financial problems. Mi Jin is still in college, and secretly loves Lee Suh Jin. She coincidentally works for Lee Suh Jin's outrageous grandmother, and while working there becomes closer to Lee Suh Jin. The only problem is that Mi Jin's cousin (also Ryu Shi Won's sister), Hae Won (Park Yae Jin) likes Lee Suh Jin too. The struggles and love that bonds a family together is beautifully portrayed in this drama.  Source: soompi.com",

This drama tackles such issues as the love of a middle-aged married couple, relations between parents and children, and problems of the elderly and women. It also takes an in-depth look at the problem of education and employment in a society that ignores human values and prioritizes educational background above everything else.  ",

He inspects his wife Bok Ja’s household accounts, wrecks meals by complaining about the food, and is stingy with even his wife’s sauna fees. Bok Ja is an extremely submissive and nice woman who was abused and treated like a housekeeper, not to mention being in a loveless marriage. She endures the bitterness until the marriage of her youngest daughter in order to fulfill her responsibility as a parent. As soon as her daughter’s wedding is over, her repressed feelings explode. She shoves divorce papers at Jong Kab and demands an end to their marriage. Jong Kab is extremely shocked by a Bok Ja he has never seen before, and tears up the divorce papers without hesitation, refusing to divorce. The four children of Jong Kab and Bok Ja ponder how to financially support their parents who are about to divorce. They all react differently to the late-life divorce of their parents and begin to think about what true love between married people is like. ",

One day she runs into her first love, Lee In Seok (Kim Yoo Suk), at a hospital that she visits for a medical checkup. Her passionate feelings toward In Seok rush back to her, but she also finds out that she has cancer.\n She faces a tough decision of whether to stay with her husband or choose In Seok, while also battling cancer. The series' characters look familiar and the plot appears to have many cliches at first glance, but the way the story unfolds stands out from other TV dramas. Unlike other series, in which cancer-stricken characters almost always die, this series shows its main character eventually win the battle with the disease. What also makes this series stand out is the scenes showing strong family ties, interesting episodes taking place in the hospital, and love stories of other characters.",

The story is about real-life figure Kim Ch'un Sam, a South Korean politician and army veteran who was given the nickname king of beggars (거지왕) as he was a beggar and gangster when he was young. Kim Doo Han, another politician who was a gangster, also appears as a character (more on him in the drama \"rustic period\"). Some facts might have been exaggerated and changed so it is not a truly accurate documentary of historic events.  In the drama, Kim Ch'un Sam joins a group of beggars as a kid and later becomes the leader of his own street gang in Seoul. He tries to protect his gang from the aggressions of the police and help his friend Kim Doo Han in gang fights. He falls in love with a young musician/actress. When the Korean War breaks out he goes to fight with his gang for the south.",

People's desire to have their say in everything, to succeed and to be beautiful stems from their deep-rooted disbelief in themselves. They are unable to love themselves the way they are. The underlying reason for the loss of interest in life is the disappointment with people. But even those who get disappointed with other human beings are negligent in loving their own selves. The main character, Kim Min Ho, was born into a family of a business tycoon but his family turned away from him because he was an illegitimate child. While having a hard time because of her mother's re-marriages, Chung Soo Hee falls in love with Kang Min Ho, who turns out to be a friend of her boyfriend, Yoo Ji An. Frivolous Choi Mi Ri loves gangster Kang Ho Chul against her family's wishes. Oh Young Sook calls herself \"crazy\" and disguises herself in a lie. All these people are linked together by the mute owner of an eatery in the neighbourhood, an old woman named Mi Young.",

Born with intelligence and into a wealthy family, he is called “his egocentric highness” in the hospital because of his arrogance. But he has compassionate love in his heart and is determined to conquer the brain by becoming the best surgeon. Hae Jo is a competent and passionate first-year neuro-surgeon in the same hospital as Yeo Wook. Yeo Wook runs into Hae Jo when he visits the emergency room of a rural hospital and gets into an argument with her about how to treat an emergency patient. Eun Hyun is a cold, workaholic fourth-year chief neuro-surgeon surrounded by an aura of mystery. He becomes more and more interested in Hae Jo, who continues to grow by overcoming various problems. Tae Jin, Yeo Wook’s father, is a great neuro-surgeon, who is also faithful to his family as a considerate father and husband. He is respected as a ‘living saint’ for proactively operating on patients without family or friends, but he believes that even his wife can be subjected to an experiment to construct a complete map of the human brain. As the long-buried secret around Tae Jin starts to unveil, the young neuro-surgeons are swept away by fate. ",

The subject of 'Bad Wife' is quite ordinary compared to other dramas. There is no amnesia nor is there an innocent child who contracts a fatal disease like other Korean dramas in the same time-slot. The changing roles of a husband and wife are not such an extraordinary or an unusual subject for a TV drama.  However, in such a banal setting, the drama succeeds in bringing out a variety of entertaining situations. By changing roles with each other, the married couple comes to face a new environment and, due to the new environment, they face changes through understanding and conflict. The drama realistically describes the process of such change, by providing a few details of some ordinary lives.",

Coincidentally, Yoo Ra and So Hyun work at the same place - So Hyun as the theater clean-up attendant, and Yoo-Ra as a staff in the production department. Park Tae-Young (Park Jung-Chul) is another staff in the production department of the theater that So Hyun and Yoo Ra work at.

Now they try to fall into self-hypnotism that they are better off than being trapped in an unhappy marriage but they can't help feeling being all alone and lonely. \"Marry Me\" is a story of how women in their thirties come to face with life and discover something new about their lives.   30 year-old spinster reporter Sin-Young was once called a \"troublemaker reporter\" but she clenched her teeth and kept digging into her work.  Soon-Ae, a 30-year-old stewardess, is the breadwinner of her family who supports her ailing father, a utterly hopeless widow aunt and another hopeless cousin.  Seung-Ri is renowned for her numerous love affairs.   Credit to Dramawiki",

This show follows the lives of a couple in their fifties and their children and elderly parents to encompass three generations.  News is instantly relayed through social media, societal issues become hot search topics in seconds through the power of smart devices, young adults can find a coffee shop on nearly every block in the city for a cup of bitter Americano in the 21st century, and the only thing that has stayed the same is that we belong to a family.  People in their fifties have to worry about the increasing numbers of elderly in the population while neglecting to build retirement savings because they are spending all of their money on their kids' education in a job market with fewer jobs. Young people use words that older people cannot understand. Casual dating has taken on a new meaning to youth and we look at three generations in a family to portray different facets of society. We also focus on the daily life of Lady Cha, who is an indomitable force in the family, to reveal aspects of a typical wholesome family. ",

This drama has a trace of genuine human touch in that it gives you an opportunity to sense the importance of life through the eyes of terminally ill woman, where ordinary events are portrayed with beauty and inspiration.\n \n \"Rosemary\" goes beyond presenting the life of a terminally ill woman. It involves a woman who tacitly prepares for death, and her husband who deeply regrets his past for not having fully expressed his love for her. It also involves an indiscreet young woman who has to take care of the dying woman's children. Through their experiences, \"Rosemary\" helps us to reminisce on the true meaning of life.\n \n (KBS)",

Eun Young and Gyung Soo meet in their early twenties when she is part of the campaign staff of a candidate in the local election. Complete opposites in everything - personality, goals, and temperament - they clash and wind up going their separate ways. 12 years later, they're now in their early thirties, and still, appear to be opposites in everything - except their desire to find the perfect mate. Now, friends, they decide to help each other out in that quest. A modern-day comedy about love, marriage, and the pressure to find both, Bean Chaff asks the question: can the two people who could never imagine being together, can finally grow up and understand what love is?",

The show's message is that there is no such thing as noble innocent love and that love is adversity itself. Therefore, love mustn't be impeded by so-called \"destiny\" or family, no matter how ironic or difficult the case may seem. Although destiny is cruel and arduous, the two young lovers radiate pure happiness. The show describes how love survives the tragic bondage of family, destiny and romance.",

People blame her strong personality for her husband’s death but she proves to them that women who go through the pain of losing their husbands gain a more profound understanding of life and can better understand the pain of others. The drama shows that women who go through an ordeal have the ability to embrace other people in pain even in the face of prejudice and forgive those who hurt them.",
