The proud parents of a pair of eighteen year old twins, the devoted couple have worked hard to build a happy home together. But what seems like an ideal life on the outside is really anything but. Fed up with Dae Young’s incessant nonsense, Da Jung is at her wits’ end. When Dae Young announces that he’s been fired, Da Jung gives up completely. Convinced life would be better without her husband in it, Da Jung wastes no time in filing for divorce.  Shaken by his wife’s decision to leave him and utterly disappointed in where life has taken him, Dae Young takes a hard look at his life. It doesn’t take him long to see all the places where things went wrong, and soon he finds himself regretting absolutely everything about his life. The moment the thoughts of regret enter his head, his body is instantly transformed into that of an eighteen year old, while his thirty-seven year old mind remains intact. Suddenly given the chance to re-do his entire life, Dae Young changes his name to Ko Woo Young and enrolls himself in his children's’ school. Seeing life from an entirely different perspective, Dae Young soon finds that despite keeping his middle-aged brain, he still has a lot to learn.     ~~ Based on the American film “17 Again.”",

    "synopsis": "Back in the 1990s, the citizens of Seoul were gripped with a paralyzing fear after a series of brutal attacks and murders occurred. A mysterious figure dubbed ‘Red Cap’ was stalking women on the streets then killing his prey, seemingly without provocation. His habit of striking at random made it impossible for the detectives to predict his next move. At the top of their minds is what could be triggering him.   Aware of the American F.B.I. and its successful use of criminal profilers to identify serial killers, the head of the Criminal Behavioral Analysis team, Gook Young Soo recruits Song Ha Young, a quiet, reserved, incredibly perceptive former detective for his team. Gook believes using this new psychological method will give the police an edge in capturing 'Red Cap' and ending his killing spree.   Homicide expert Yoon Tae Goo and her officers question the value of this approach and are resistant to entering such uncharted territory. To quell their scorn they need to convince that this radical crime-fighting approach will increase their arrest rates. Does Song Ha Young have the ability to gain the trust of callous criminals while seeing through them? Is he clever enough to outwit them?  But more importantly, does he possess the emotional fortitude to withstand the process?     ~~ Adapted from the autobiography of the same title, co-written by Korea's first criminal profiler, Kwon Il Yong and journalist-turned-author Ko Na Mu, depicting some of Kwon's field experiences.",

Cha Yo Han is a genius anesthesiologist, who is also the youngest professor at his medical school.

Ha Sun grew up with the clowns and became one of them. During their performance, Ha Sun would play King Lee Hun due to their similar physical appearance.

    "synopsis": "Tae Kyung is a 18-year-old high school student. He is also a lifelong loner. But one day, he starts questioning his own judgment and tells a teacher that he no longer wishes to be alone. The problem is, he has no idea how to start going about making new friends. The teacher advises him to join the school’s student council. He agrees, but discovers that making friends may be harder than it seems.  He meets the Vice President of the council, Shin Woo, who is cool and level-headed, but also somewhat cold toward him and reluctant to accept Tae Kyung. However, he also meets the super-attractive President of the council: Da On, who appears to take an instant shine to him. The beginnings of a romance appear to be in the cards for Da On and Tae Kyung, but Shin Woo does not seem to approve. Matters are further complicated by the fact that Da On’s close female friend – who secretly loves Da On – is jealous of their closeness, and attempts to drive a wedge between them!    ~~ Adapted from the mobile game “Saebit Boys High School Council\" (새빛남고학생회) by Day7 (데이세븐).",

Sun Woo is a conceited star chef who’s overflowing with confidence in his food and his skills. Bong Sun harbours a secret crush on him, though he doesn't take much notice of her for two reasons: because he’s always surrounded by women and because he’s hung up on an old flame.

But as the rest of the group – whom he knows nothing about – have decided to leave him to do all the work on his own, he decides to remove their names, and make the presentation in his name.

Seo Gong Myung is guided by his moral convictions, which he staunchly adheres to, opting to do everything ‘by the book’.  His lack of flexibility and his penchant for criticizing all those who enter his domain, not only serve to earn him the nickname ‘Great Lucifer’, but more enemies than friends.

Known as the ‘Queen of Civil Complaints’, she’s a force to be reckoned with! She’s held many positions in the past, none of which have materialized into a stable source of income. Small wonder the opening on the District People's Council, with an annual salary of 50 million won for a mere 90 working days, could be just the ticket she needs to better her circumstances.

While the events were never fully understood, nor the mystery behind them solved, the stories surrounding the village slowly faded, drifting into obscurity amidst the steady passing of time. But when a new string of mysterious incidents begin to take place, memories long-forgotten begin to resurface, and this time, the villagers' cries for help will not go unheard.   A legend among his peers, Do Jung Woo is the leader of one of the National Police Agency’s special task forces. While his outward appearance likens him more to an unruly child than a legendary officer, his keen insight and quick wit make him more than capable of solving any crime. After reports of numerous mysterious incidents begin to filter in, Jung Woo springs into action. But this isn’t a mystery he’s allowed to solve on his own. Working alongside Jung Woo, Officer Gong Hye Won refuses to let anything stand between her and what she wants.   Tenacious and hot-tempered, she’s determined to solve every case, by any means necessary, and this case is no exception. Joined by Jamie, a detective on loan from the FBI, Jung Woo and Hye Won set out to unravel the present mysteries of this small village. But they soon realize that the incidents of the present tie strongly to those of the past. Will this team of experts be able to solve a case nearly thirty years in the making?",

He spends several years becoming a great warrior. Dam, who has a photographic memory, becomes a court lady called So Yi, but she feels so guilty about her role in the other slaves' deaths that she is mute. Ddol Bok returns to the palace under the name of Kang Chae Yoon in order to kill the king. However, he becomes embroiled in the mystery surrounding the deaths of several Hall of Worthies scholars. The deaths were caused by a secret society called \"Hidden Root,\" which was created long ago by followers of Jeong Do Jeon, with the goal of giving more power to ministers and less to the king. King Tae Jong killed Jeong Do Jeon and all of his family except his nephew, Jeong Gi Joon, who is now the leader of Hidden Root and lives in disguise not far from King Se Jong.",

A producer approaches her about participating in a reality TV show whose premise is that of a celebrity living with their anti-fan. Unemployed, she jumps at the opportunity.

Kwak Hyun who practices internal medicine is the first army doctor to volunteer for duty on the hospital ship. Then there is the irritating Jae Geol, an oriental medicine doctor who drew the short straw and now has to serve on the hospital ship. A bunch of doctors with different backgrounds finds themselves afloat at sea. They are too old to be called youthful doctors as they are all in their thirties.

Determined to become the first Empress of Goguryeo, Pyeong Gang will stop at nothing to make her dream come true. Clever and level-headed, Pyeong Gang is well aware of the obstacles that stand in her way, but she's more than capable of taking them on. However, things take an unexpected turn the day she meets On Dal, a peace-loving man whose sole goal in life is to live in harmony with those around him.   On Dal is the exact opposite of the ambitious princess. He is an oasis of calm amid the turbulent storms in Pyeong Gang's life. The warrior princess soon finds herself falling for gentle On Dal. He's equally in love with the princess, whose heart he now possesses. He finds himself forsaking his principles to keep her safe, an endeavor proving to be increasingly difficult, as warring factions lethally vie for the throne. Forced to match both wits and strength against some of the most powerful people in Goguryeo, Pyeong Gang's quest for power could very well cost her everything.

But during the ultra-conservative Joseon Dynasty era (1392-1910), the only woman with the power to order a manhunt for a murderer is the Queen. So Kang Eun Bo resolves to win the prized royal title so she can one day avenge her sister’s death. To do so, however, she must first win the heart of Joseon King Lee Kyung. Lee Kyung grew up in a time of great political unrest, and is less interested in matters of the heart – and more concerned with bringing peace to the realm. Kang Eun Bo soon discovers that winning the king’s favor will not be easy; the royal court is also inundated with beautiful young women, many of whom hope to wed the king. But when the king suddenly realizes that he recognizes Kang Eun Bo from a dream, the two begin to form an unlikely bond. Will Kang Eun Bo ever find her twin’s killer? And could love bloom between the streetwise Kang Eun Bo and the idealistic king?",

He was once the brilliant PD of the nation's top live music program. But his fall from grace occurs when members of an indie band he'd cast drop their pants onstage and flash the entire country during a live broadcast (based on a real-life incident on MBC in 2005).

But it’s not the constant stream of guests that has Hae Won concerned; it’s the fact that the restaurant’s owner and head chef, Baek Eun Kyu, seems to have a serious problem with him. Having been recommended for a part-time job at the restaurant by Cha Ji Soo, a fellow restaurant owner, Hae Won thought he would easily fit in with the staff; but for some reason Eun Kyu seems to instantly dislike him.  Despite the fact that he can’t figure out why his boss is so bothered by him, Hae Won finds himself fitting in nicely with his fellow staff members, Ha Jin and Joo Seo Hyuk. It isn’t long before he’s drawing as much attention from the restaurant patrons as his equally handsome co-workers.  With such a good-looking staff, there’s never a shortage of admirers at the Florida Banjeom. It comes as no surprise to Hae Won that almost everyone who visits the restaurant eventually falls for the devastatingly handsome Eun Kyu. What does surprise him is when he realizes that he himself has fallen. But will he ever be able to win the heart of his cold-hearted boss?",

    "synopsis": "This romantic comedy follows a woman who has an aversion to flower boys and a man who has an obsession with appearance.   The female lead, Joo Seo Yeon, is a hot-tempered physical education high school teacher who always wears sneakers, jeans and training uniforms.  The death of her parents helped instill a deep sense of compassion, a generous heart and an outspoken objection for anyone who drinks and drives. Living in a house with three irascible and very attractive brothers, she loathes flower boys. Her ideal type is someone who is “not handsome.”   In contrast, the male lead, Lee Kang Woo, is a handsome chaebol who focuses primarily on outer appearance. Initially, he craved attention, oozed arrogance and loved his looks--despite the strict diet and exercise regimen required to maintain it. While he appears flawless, he (like everyone else) was wounded while growing up. And those flaws--along with everyone else's--drive the story.    Sparks fly when they meet and struggle to overcome their biases for and against people with flaws. Throughout the drama they learn to see beyond appearances to the tragic backstories and scars that motivate themselves and the people around them.",

This leads him to leave the military. In his new civilian life, he gets hired by a foreign retail distribution company and becomes the head manager of a large retail store. The retailer he works for slashes labor costs by firing part-time workers before they can qualify for benefits and higher wages. He cannot tolerate the company's poor and immoral treatment, so he decides to fight against the management. However, as he faces pressure from the company, he is forced to seek help from a labor counseling center and meets Go Shin, the center's manager. His only way to win the case is to utilize the Labor Act like a sword in his mission to fight against corruption and illegal corporate behavior. He boldly 'pierces into' the society that suppresses individual people with tyranny, just like an awl that bores a hole into the stiff wall...

Although her glittering journalistic career spans a decade, her home situation is not quite as idyllic as those she spends her time reporting on. In fact, she lives alone in a rented house and happily makes adjustments as she sees fit. But when the magazine’s CEO Yoo Ja Sung buys the house and becomes her fussy new landlord, she is in for a shock.  Yoo Ja Sung proves to be a very difficult landlord to keep happy. He grew up in poverty, initially working in the construction industry, but determined to make his fortune through real estate investment. For him, buying the house Na Young Won lives in is little more than another financial transaction. But as the duo starts to get to know one another, their attitudes toward the real estate market – and one another – start to change. Suddenly, Na Young Won starts to ask herself if she would be better off buying her own house...or beginning on an unlikely romance with her firm’s CEO!",

After failing to get into a highly-competitive, top-ranked foreign-language high school, she is forced to enroll at Seonam Girl’s High School by her mother who figures that Chae Yul could get straight As at a less-competitive public high school. She believed that it would eventually help Chae Yul get into a top university. On her first day at the all-girls high school, Chae Yul is assaulted by “Biter,” a perverted and demented guy. This incident quickly spreads through the school and everyone gossips about it. To avoid peer attention, she hides in a secluded spot on campus. But she also happens to pass by Mr. Yeon Jun, one of the school’s teachers. “This cologne… It’s the exact same cologne that the “Biter” was wearing!’ Now Chae Yul becomes highly suspicious of Yeon Jun. Her inexplicable karmic connection with Yeon Jun, the mystery teacher, begins. While Chae Yul is still confused by everything that is happening around her, four strange girls who call themselves the “Seonam Girl’s High School Detectives” bump into her. “We’re also victims of ‘Biter.’ Help us track him down,” the girls say. It was such an odd request and Chae Yul refused to join them, but she eventually finds herself helping the group find the offender. To their surprise, they uncover an uncomfortable secret that goes much deeper than they could have ever imagined!",

Ha Do Sung composes songs in anonymity as rock star HADES. Having been abandoned at a young age by his ambitious mother, he tries to live quietly without drawing attention to himself. Kim Byeong Gun is the odd one out in his family of businessmen, wishing to pursue a career in musicals - despite his debilitating fear of performing in front of others. Eun Chae Young is an experienced actress, having been in the industry for 10 years. However, she has the desire to prove herself on the musical stage, rather than a movie actress with a pretty face. What she doesn't expect is to be challenged by Oh Doo Ri, an equally talented actress who prefers to spend her time playing first-person shooting computer games than rehearsing.  These young adults end up together in the musical department of Haneul Arts University and find themselves under the guidance of unconventional professor Sunwoo Young. With each passing day, they get a chance to learn what it is to be a 'star,' and to prove to the people around them that they can succeed in their chosen path.",

They begin falling into a special kind of love, based on the unique subject of 'cellular memory' (medical term, a symptom where recipients remember the habits or personalities of the donors and since a body's cells store memory independently from the brain, it leads to an organ transplant's recipient to form new habits similar to the donor). On the other hand, Kang Dong Wook is a cardiothoracic surgeon and conflict arises when his first love, a beautiful, sensible and eloquent woman, falls in love with Dong Ha, his hyung. Bae Ji Won wants the widower for herself and she’ll do her best to redirect his attentions.

Thirty years ago, when her husband passed away in an accident, Kang Sunok raised her teenage daughters alone. She became famous for her cooking classes with the help of a talented young disciple named Park Eunsil. The oldest daughter, Hyeonjeong, eventually became a well-known news presenter. She has worked hard and never married, but as the story starts, changes are about to come as her boss favours younger women. Sunoks second daughter, Hyunsuk, cared more about pop music than about schoolwork, and stirred up intense dislike within her teacher. She got expelled from school due to a series of events, got married and had a daughter, Jeong Mari, at a young age. She made her child’s success her life’s priority and Mari studied hard to get her PhD in Korean literature before the age of 30.  As the drama starts, Hyunsuk is desperate to make more money to help her family, but things don’t go well. She happens to befriend a wealthy woman, Jang Moran, who becomes deeply involved with the family. Moran is elegant and rich, but she has kept a secret for 30 years – but can, or should, secrets be kept forever?   Jang Moran isn’t the only woman to enter the struggling family’s life. Na Hyeonae, winner of the Teacher of the Year award and a doting mother, and none other than the person who ruined Hyunsuk’s life, shows up. Hyunsuk makes a promise to herself to force an apology out of this woman – a mission that turns out not to be so easy.   In the meantime, Hyunsuk’s estranged husband does his best to quietly help, while three men with the same family name, Lee, also become important parts of the women’s lives.",

The band’s lead singer is Yoo Ha Young, whose YouTube cover version of a popular song became a viral online hit. However, she wants to become a singer in her own right – someone who is known for performing original material, rather than covers. But it looks like the group’s guitarist, Yoo Ha Young’s close friend Lee Ji Hoon, is developing feelings for her – as is Gong Chan Young, an older keyboard player who also joins the band. Meanwhile, there are also sparks flying between bassist and Yoo Ha Young’s best friend Lim Seo Eun and the band’s eclectic drummer and academic no-hoper Shim Tae Young.",

But the journey to the top of South Korea’s fashion tree is not an easy one, and he is struggling to find the right path. One day, on the street, he bumps into Yeong Woo, an ever-optimistic part-time delivery worker. Even though it seems everyone he knows has formulated a grand plan about how their future will unfurl, Yeong Woo doesn’t have a dream. While all others are in a rush to get somewhere in life, it seems that his own life is stuck in first gear.  Although things have got off to a decidedly shaky start for Ki Jin and Yeong Woo, they start to develop a fondness for one another, and start to wonder if their seemingly opposing blend of determinedness and acceptance could be a case of “opposites attract.” But when a leading model named Lee Bin arrives on the scene, things get complicated. He starts to develop a crush on Ki Jin. Could this development spell the end for the fledgling romance between Ki Jin and Yeong Woo?",

Having recently broken up with her boyfriend, Sa Ri was hopeful she had left that part of her life in the past. But when he makes an unexpected return, things get complicated. As if dealing with her ex wasn’t confusing enough, Sa Ri begins to realize that one of her oldest friends, Pi Jung Won, has started to develop feelings for her. As she attempts to sort out her own feelings for the talented artist, Sa Ri finds herself frequently crossing paths with Ki Sun Jae, the handsome and friendly CEO of the company where she works. Though it’s not always easy to tell what Sun Jae is thinking, there are times when a single look from him is enough to make her confused heart flutter. To make matters worse, Sa Ri finds that she has inadvertently captured the attention of Yeon Ha Rim. Despite the fact that he’s several years younger than her, he has no qualms about expressing his feelings.  Inadvertently drawing the attention of four different men, Sa Ri finds herself completely unsure of what to do next.

Bubbly host Boo Hye Ryung is in her thirties and has been married to the handsome lawyer Pan Sa Huyn for three years. This busy couple remains child-free by choice. Sa Huyn was first taken with her after seeing her play the drums.  Sa Pi Young is a hard-working producer for the show. In her forties, she has always done her best to take care of her home, daughter, and her charming husband, Shin Yoo Shin, psychiatrist and hospital director of the neuropsychiatry department.  By anyone's measure, Pi Young is the ideal wife.   The show’s dedicated writer Lee Si Eun, now in her fifties, has been married for thirty years to her sweet professor husband and they share two pre-teens. Park Hae Ryoon is now the dean of the Theatre and Film Department at  Sun Jin University. Lee Si Eun made many sacrifices in order to support her husband's dream of becoming a film professor early in their marriage.   Seo Ban, the show's sound technician is single, a man of few words who keeps a tight lid on his private life. He is a man of mystery to his curious colleagues.  Three equally successful women will prove to be the unraveling of each of their so-called 'happy marriages.'   Song Won is divorced, a  skilled literary translator of Chinese, and lawyer Sa Hyun's mature gym partner.  A Mi is single in her twenties and has spent the last two years shuttling between South Korea and the US in order to complete her studies. A shared airplane seat and a love of horses bring her and the doctor together. Add into the mix, Yoo Shin's unusual relationship with his father's new wife, a classy, well-kept woman who raised him from childhood. Dean Hae Ryoon hires the beloved actress, Nam Ga-Bin, whose career he has followed, to teach at the university, bringing the two in welcomed routine contact.     Mistresses aside, each couple has an achilles heel that brings about much unhappiness, could trigger divorce proceedings, and leave them all wondering just how much happiness are we entitled to in life?",

At 20 years old, On Joon Yeong is a nerdy, smart university student who wears plain clothes, plain glasses, and doesn't obsess over fashion. He plans everything in his day meticulously, grows frustrated easily, overthinks things, and is very sensitive. With the guidance of his friends, he takes part in a blind date where he meets Lee Yeong Jae. Lee Yeong Jae is also 20 years old, doesn't attend university and instead works as an assistant hairdresser. Lee Yeong Jae has had a difficult life and is an orphan who looks up immensely to her brother, Lee Soo Jae, a barista. She is honest, hardworking, and somewhat daring: the complete opposite to Oh Joon Yeong. Her dream is to become rich, though she would rather get there by her own perseverance. One day, her friend takes her to a blind date group with university students. At the meeting, she encounters Joon Yeong and goes on a date with him. From there, at 20 years old, their love story begins.",

With natural beauty and a slew of vampire abilities, Yeon Seo could be anything she wanted, but she has chosen to blend in with those who appear closest to her age. As a result, Yeon Seo now finds herself faced with one of life’s most difficult challenges: graduating from high school.  Fighting back her more vampiric urges, Yeon Seo does her best to blend in at school; a task that, for the most part, has been fairly easy. But when the sweet blood of her classmate, Song Meo Roo, attracts the attention of vampires and werewolves alike, things get a little more complicated. Trying desperately to ignore the siren call of Meo Roo’s blood, Yeon Seo takes it upon herself to protect her classmate from those who hunt him.   As Yeon Seo and Meo Roo run for their lives, the blood in his veins calls to her. Torn between family duty and the desires of her own heart, a war within Yeon Seo rages. Will she be able to embrace her humanity and resist the temptation of this boy’s sweet blood or will her vampire side rise victorious in the end?    ~~ Adapted from the webtoon \"The Sweet Girl\" (달달한그녀) by writer S and illustrator Nal Chi (날치).",

It is a special love story of a high school senior at a girls school with an IQ of 98 but ranking first in looks in her school and of a poor college student studying law. Eun Min meets Tae Kyeong, a college student, when she goes to the university library to run an errand for her sister. She instantly falls in love and lies to him about being a scenario writer and starts dating him. Tae Kyeong, of course, also falls in love with the charming Eun Min. However, Eun Min's lie doesn't last long.  Eun Min and Tae Kyeong meet each other again as a private tutor and student. Tae Kyeong tells Eun Min, who hates studying more than anything, that she should do something else if she doesn't want to go to college, and drags her to the HAJA Center. The reason she listened to him without any further worries is that she believed that he would not ask her to do something that's not right. She had faith in him. She thought that she would be able to live a different life if she were with him. Tae Kyeong was the first thing that had ever been only hers. Therefore, Eun Min decides to get married to him! The marriage was her first accomplishment. The ten-million-won-leased room in the basement that the in-laws found for them has no windows. But why worry about not having a window? One can just draw windows on the wall, place a bucket under the leak in the ceiling and hold a rat-catching event with Tae Kyeong in case there are rats! For some time at first, poverty was just a game for her.",

Self-serving Ming generals and Joseon officials also fear Yi's growing popularity and its impact on their personal base of power. These incidentally combining ambitions fan King Seon Jo's paranoia and make him eventually fear that Yi might come after his throne, and after a series of what he calls acts of high treason he decides to have Yi arrested.  Yi, on the other hand, is determined to teach the Japanese a lesson for the atrocities they committed on the Korean people, and despite orders to remain quiet while the Japanese are to pull out without anymore bloodshed, he rallies his naval force and prepares for the upcoming battle. the battle commences and the Japanese are dealt a crippling blow, but Yi is fatally wounded by an arquebuse bullet. As he lays dying, the plot backtracks important stations of Yi's life, from his boyhood to his military career, his disgrace at the hands of his king and his reinstatement, back to the battle of Noryang, where he succumbs to his wound just as victory is declared.",

His younger brother, Choon Bo, is kind, caring, and submissive to him. The two brothers have not seen each other for nearly twenty years, since Choon Bo gave his youngest son, Yeong Goo, to Man Bo because he wanted a son. Choon Bo’s wife believes that her youngest son died at birth. Twenty years later, Choon Bo goes bankrupt, and with nowhere to go, asks his brother for help. Living in the small house next to Man Bo’s, Choon Bo brings his three children, his daughter-in-law, and his wife with him. Together they live towards a brighter day. Man Bo’s wife and daughter are eager to make Choon Bo’s daughter, Soo Jin’s life miserable. When Soo Jin and Mi Ree again fight over the same guy, it is no surprise that the nice girl wins. As two families clash over women, men, family secrets and money matters, the good guy teaches the “bad guy” a lesson – just like the Korean folktale.",

But born with a strong will, optimistic personality, and persistence, she opens up a potato stew diner and raises her younger siblings and her daughter. She even enrolls herself in college at her age and struggles to realize her own dreams.  The middle sister of the three, Gyung Sook, divorced from her first marriage after her ex-husband’s affair, but she is having marital problems again with her second husband, Jung Wan. Haeng Sook tells Gyung Sook that there is no “right” way to live life and although the number of divorces she gets in her life is insignificant, she should try to love a man with all her heart before breaking up. That way, she will not have regrets.  Haeng Sook goes on to advise that she should realize the true value of human life and become more confident. The youngest of the three, Hyo Sook, married the man she fell in love with at first sight, but her husband Sang Min doesn’t consider her a woman and constantly asks for divorce. Haeng Sook encourages her by saying that although it seems like the end of the world, life goes on. She goes on to tell Hyo Sook that as long as she is alive, the sun will rise tomorrow, and she has the right to be happier than anyone else in the world.",

Her life becomes difficult after her father, a once-popular singer, meets with an accident that was planned by his wife. Dan Bi then finds out that she was adopted. Her stepmother takes advantage of her husband's comatose state to kick Dan Bi out of their house, all in a plot to sell his land to the ruthless chairman of a hospital company.  This revelation leads Dan Bi to begin searching for her birth mother by using her adoptive father's will as leverage, not knowing that the truth about what happened to her birth father is directly tied to the chairman. She encounters several people along the way: the chairman's grandson who falls for Dan Bi but is uncertain of the outcome if they became a couple; a divorced lawyer whom Dan Bi loves, but whose father is also connected to her birth father, which is the reason why the lawyer's mother disapproves of Dan Bi for her son; the lawyer's ex-wife, and their daughter who likes Dan Bi more than her own mother; a step-sister who sees Dan Bi as a roadblock to climbing the corporate ladder; and an ailing doctor who was not only the love of Dan Bi's adoptive father's life, but knows the real truth about Dan Bi's parentage.

Instead it’s filled with how a few youths, who have burning passion inside them, go through the everyday ups and downs of life and mixed fortunes with love and fate. The characters have distinct personalities and are full of fun. This drama will trigger something in young people who think that love is just a spur of the moment, in a world where everything is becoming digital to the extreme, by drawing the warmth that human love points to and by showing them a way of finding the truth about love. -Drama Wiki",

    "synopsis": "Choi Jin Shil stars as Lee Ok Hwa, a good-spirited \"yun-byun\" (Korean person living in China) girl from China. Ryu Shi Won is an entertainments reporter that happens to find himself in trouble when he's in China. He is played around with by kkang ppaes, but Lee Ok Hwa saves him when she finds out one of the kkang ppaes is her own brother. When Ok Hwa comes to Korea to work under Ryu Shi Won's uncle, Ryu Shi Won tries to pretend like he never knew Ok Hwa, which doesn't work out. They always get in fusses and fights, but those are what bring them closer together. On the other hand, Ok Hwa lives with her boss's sister and her two children. The twins, Su Jin and Mi Jin (Park Jin Hee) are bright kids that grew up very well despite the difficult financial problems. Mi Jin is still in college, and secretly loves Lee Suh Jin. She coincidentally works for Lee Suh Jin's outrageous grandmother, and while working there becomes closer to Lee Suh Jin. The only problem is that Mi Jin's cousin (also Ryu Shi Won's sister), Hae Won (Park Yae Jin) likes Lee Suh Jin too. The struggles and love that bonds a family together is beautifully portrayed in this drama.  Source: soompi.com",

So-min (the character) is a little behind the fashions and tends to say weird things that puzzle people, but she’s got a warm heart and a generous personality. Sadly, though, it’s that trusting nature that also makes her a target for opportunists.  - Dramabeans",

One day she runs into her first love, Lee In Seok (Kim Yoo Suk), at a hospital that she visits for a medical checkup. Her passionate feelings toward In Seok rush back to her, but she also finds out that she has cancer.\n She faces a tough decision of whether to stay with her husband or choose In Seok, while also battling cancer. The series' characters look familiar and the plot appears to have many cliches at first glance, but the way the story unfolds stands out from other TV dramas. Unlike other series, in which cancer-stricken characters almost always die, this series shows its main character eventually win the battle with the disease. What also makes this series stand out is the scenes showing strong family ties, interesting episodes taking place in the hospital, and love stories of other characters.",

    "synopsis": "From the colonial period to the Park Chung Hee military regime this drama covers many crucial events of Korean history from the view of a gang of beggars. The story is about real-life figure Kim Ch'un Sam, a South Korean politician and army veteran who was given the nickname king of beggars (거지왕) as he was a beggar and gangster when he was young. Kim Doo Han, another politician who was a gangster, also appears as a character (more on him in the drama \"rustic period\"). Some facts might have been exaggerated and changed so it is not a truly accurate documentary of historic events.  In the drama, Kim Ch'un Sam joins a group of beggars as a kid and later becomes the leader of his own street gang in Seoul. He tries to protect his gang from the aggressions of the police and help his friend Kim Doo Han in gang fights. He falls in love with a young musician/actress. When the Korean War breaks out he goes to fight with his gang for the south.",

People's desire to have their say in everything, to succeed and to be beautiful stems from their deep-rooted disbelief in themselves. They are unable to love themselves the way they are. The underlying reason for the loss of interest in life is the disappointment with people. But even those who get disappointed with other human beings are negligent in loving their own selves.

The subject of 'Bad Wife' is quite ordinary compared to other dramas. There is no amnesia nor is there an innocent child who contracts a fatal disease like other Korean dramas in the same time-slot. The changing roles of a husband and wife are not such an extraordinary or an unusual subject for a TV drama.  However, in such a banal setting, the drama succeeds in bringing out a variety of entertaining situations. By changing roles with each other, the married couple comes to face a new environment and, due to the new environment, they face changes through understanding and conflict. The drama realistically describes the process of such change, by providing a few details of some ordinary lives.",

People in their fifties have to worry about the increasing numbers of elderly in the population while neglecting to build retirement savings because they are spending all of their money on their kids' education in a job market with fewer jobs. Young people use words that older people cannot understand. Casual dating has taken on a new meaning to youth and we look at three generations in a family to portray different facets of society. We also focus on the daily life of Lady Cha, who is an indomitable force in the family, to reveal aspects of a typical wholesome family.",

This drama has a trace of genuine human touch in that it gives you an opportunity to sense the importance of life through the eyes of terminally ill woman, where ordinary events are portrayed with beauty and inspiration.\n \n \"Rosemary\" goes beyond presenting the life of a terminally ill woman. It involves a woman who tacitly prepares for death, and her husband who deeply regrets his past for not having fully expressed his love for her. It also involves an indiscreet young woman who has to take care of the dying woman's children. Through their experiences, \"Rosemary\" helps us to reminisce on the true meaning of life.\n \n (KBS)",

Two non-identical individuals met and lived together. What is left in their lives in the end? What are they achieving, and what are they losing? They gain wealth, success, and they have a child– Let’s stop this out-of-date thinking. Since the two cannot be the same till the very end, wouldn’t it be better to just live as two individuals, instead of a married couple? And, there is one thing that we should remember about others. Before we have our roles as a husband, a wife, a parent, a son, and a daughter, we are all human beings who have the right to accomplish our own genuine lives.",

Eun Young and Gyung Soo meet in their early twenties when she is part of the campaign staff of a candidate in the local election. Complete opposites in everything - personality, goals, and temperament - they clash and wind up going their separate ways. 12 years later, they're now in their early thirties, and still, appear to be opposites in everything - except their desire to find the perfect mate. Now, friends, they decide to help each other out in that quest. A modern-day comedy about love, marriage, and the pressure to find both, Bean Chaff asks the question: can the two people who could never imagine being together, can finally grow up and understand what love is?",

The show's message is that there is no such thing as noble innocent love and that love is adversity itself. Therefore, love mustn't be impeded by so-called \"destiny\" or family, no matter how ironic or difficult the case may seem. Although destiny is cruel and arduous, the two young lovers radiate pure happiness. The show describes how love survives the tragic bondage of family, destiny and romance.",

    "synopsis": "Korean society is increasingly becoming matrilineal, with more women holding a high social status, record-low birthrates and a shift of the leadership role in family from husband to wife and from the paternal side to the maternal one. This drama introduces a new family type that centers on women. Its main character — a widow — wins the battle against social prejudice. People blame her strong personality for her husband’s death but she proves to them that women who go through the pain of losing their husbands gain a more profound understanding of life and can better understand the pain of others. The drama shows that women who go through an ordeal have the ability to embrace other people in pain even in the face of prejudice and forgive those who hurt them.",

A successful and intelligent young man, he has been in love with his childhood friend Lee Kyung Hwa for years. However, his mother disapproves due to her family background and constantly harasses her. Su Jae's good friend and business partner, Jung Goo Kyung, is in love with Kyung Hwa, and taking advantage of Su Jae's absence during a business trip, persuades Kyung Hwa to marry him so that she can be happy. Will these two ever find happiness?",

Born in a remote island of Che Ju, far south from the mainland, Hae Jin and Hae Won, always had opposite characters. Hae Jin was always smart, pretty and best at everything she did but Hae Won was kind, good to her father and always believed she was inferior to her elder sister. \n Many years later Hae Jin grows up to become a MC at a cable TV network. She strives to become Cinderella through men around her - first she plans to climb the ladder of success through dating her senior manager, then repentlessly changes her dating partner to the heir of a renowned enterprise in order to rise her social position through marriage. \n Unlike her sister, Hae Wun is a common girl at the beginning of the drama. Yet, once spotted by a president at an advertising company and is inquired to become a model for a make-up company, the sweet yet dismal path to success lies before her. \n In this drama, Cinderella Complex is criss-crossed with tense complex between sisters. The psychological description and the compact structure of love, jealousy and hatred truly makes an exquisite quality melodrama which brings tears and compassion to viewers of wide range.",
